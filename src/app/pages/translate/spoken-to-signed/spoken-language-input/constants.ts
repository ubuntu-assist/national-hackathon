const textConst = `is the Google project management

certificate actually worth it or not

that's we're going to be going over in

this video I'm going to talk about a

brief overview of the course then we're

going to get into the time of completion

the cost the demand the salary the

production value the chances of Landing

you a job and the overall value of the

course and then I'm going to be ranking

all of these on a scale from 1 to 10

with 10 being the best then at the very

end I'll give you a final score and let

you know whether I think this

certificate is worth it or not and what

people would be best served by taking

this cert so if you appreciate me doing

these types of videos go ahead gently

tap that like button and let's jump

right into it alright so this is the

Google project management professional

certificate that is hosted on Coursera

they claim that you can start your path

to a career in project management in

this program you'll learn in-demand

skills that will have you job ready in

less than six months no degree or

experience is required so I will put a

link to the the certificate down in the

description as well as the pin comment

below there is a seven day free trial so

you can check it out for free for seven

days and if you choose to keep taking

the certificate it costs about thirty

nine dollars a month also if you're

watching this video and you have taken

the certificate please comment down

below your experiences so that we can

all learn from it whether it was

positive or negative or you can share

both the pros and the cons now let's go

ahead and do a bit of an overview of all

the different courses within this

certificate so there is six total

courses that you have to take in order

to complete the certificate course

number one is foundations of project

management course two is Project

initiation starting a successful project

course three is Project planning putting

it all together course four is Project

execution running the project course 5

is agile project management and course

six is the Capstone which is applying

project management in the real world in

all of the courses have either a 4.8 or

a 4.9 star rating so they are all

excellent now at the end of this course

I believe you have to take a test and in

the test is not proctored so obviously

it's going to be relatively easy to pass

all right so now let's go ahead and talk

about the time to completion right so

how long is it going to take you to

complete this course now according to

google they say it takes about six

months to complete the course if you

study under 10 hours a week it's also

100 self-paced so you can study anytime

you want whether that's in the morning

before work during your lunch break

after work whenever you can so obviously

there's pros and cons to that the pros

is you can study whenever you have time

the cons is you have to be

self-motivated and self-directed now

they say it's going to take about six

months but almost all of the

self-reporting shows that you can finish

it much quicker than that so for

instance this person says that it

doesn't take six months but it requires

a lot of time I'm in a temporary labor

adjustment and have time to do it daily

and it took me almost a month so this

person finished it in a month but they

say at a normal Pace whatever that means

it would take about three months either

of those mean that it would be a lot

faster than six this person here says

that it took them about 160 hours total

which is a lot less than the 240 hours

that they claim it's going to take you

so depending on your situation you know

maybe you're super busy you've got a

family a full-time job Etc or maybe you

have tons of time I would estimate this

is going to take you around one to three

months to complete and that's really

fast if you compare it to a boot camp

which typically takes three months all

the way up to a year or a college degree

which takes 5.1 years on average so when

it comes to the time to completion this

is extremely fast I'm going to give it a

9 out of 10. next we're going to talk

about the cost of the certificate now

obviously the comparisons here would be

a college degree or a boot camp College

costs about a hundred thousand dollars

boot camps are typically going to cost

ten thousand dollars or even more so

compared to those Coursera at about 39 a

month let's say it takes you three

months that's going to be a little over

a hundred dollars around 120 right and

there's a range there so let's say it

takes you six months that would be 234

dollars if it takes you two months that

would be about 78 dollars so obviously

very affordable especially compared to a

boot camp or a college degree now

Coursera also does offer financial aid

if you can't afford the 39 a month so

definitely look into that I've heard

that they do approve people quite often

and this is the price for the US and

Canada so if you live in another country

and this certificate is available it

typically will be less so again just

check the link down below I believe it's

like Geo located so it'll show you what

the price is in Your Country Now

Coursera does have a refund policy they

give you the first seven days for free

and as long as you cancel your

subscription within those first seven

days you get a full refund you're not

going to have to pay anything but if you

don't cancel your subscription you will

not be able to get a refund so I guess

that would be one of the downsides to

doing Coursera I think the reason they

do that is because if they allowed

people to get a refund after the 30-day

period most people would just game the

system finish the certificate really

quickly and then get their refund for

free now when you compare the cost of

this certificate to its big biggest

rival in certificates that would be the

cap M certificate that is offered by the

project management Institute this

certificate typically you know you're

going to finish it in two to three

months so it's going to be somewhere

between 78 to about 120 dollars the

project management Institute certificate

is going to be 300 for non-members and

225 dollars for members right so even

when you compare it to other

certificates it's still extremely

affordable so the only score I can give

here is obviously going to be a 10 out

of 10. this is probably the most

affordable way that you can give

yourself a chance of Landing a job with

something that only costs you like 78

dollars all right next let's go ahead

and talk about the demand so on the home

page of this certificate they say right

off the bat there are 479

000 in-demand job openings in project

management and when you finish the

certificate you'll actually get access

to a private job board so this is the

Google Coursera job platform where a

group of more than 150 employers are

hiring for open roles and there are

employer consortiums that are currently

available in the U.S Canada India

Singapore Indonesia and they are coming

to more countries soon and the in-demand

job specifically that they say this

certificate will get you ready for are

going to be project manager project

coordinator project assistant operations

manager operations associate program

manager scrum master and project

associate so let's go ahead and look at

the demand at the entry level for all of

these different careers so if you go to

LinkedIn you sort by jobs and you sort

by entry level only and you type in

project manager you're going to see 74

000 results for project coordinator

you're going to see 30 000 results 66

000 for project assistant 68 000 for

operations manager 76 000 for program

manager 33 000 for scrum master and 25

000 for project associate so it does

seem like there are a ton of entry-level

jobs available for a lot of those

different positions and if you look at

BLS you type in project management

specialist you are going to see 681 000

total jobs and it's growing at seven

percent which is as fast as average so

that's very healthy now another thing

that's really amazing this is basically

a pro tip that a lot of people are not

doing but I've gotten a ton of positive

feedback on this when I started telling

people to do this is to put this on

LinkedIn right so even if you haven't

finished the certificate yet right but

you are in the process of taking it go

ahead and put that on LinkedIn and you

will probably notice that recruiters

will start adding you and reaching out

to you and that is because people

actually search through Linkedin using

these certificates and if you put that

you're just taking it they will find you

it's even better if you finish the

certificate you'll probably get a lot of

people hitting you up so that is another

great way for you to get noticed and

overall just project management

operations management it's something

that is super important operations are

incredibly important to any company out

there and so this is one of those skills

that's just never gonna go away overall

I'm gonna give it a 9.5 out of 10. next

we are going to be talking about the

salary so on the home page they say

seventy three thousand dollar median

entry level salary if you type in some

of those careers that they mentioned on

Glassdoor you're gonna see eighty four

thousand dollars for a project manager

fifty six thousand for a project

coordinator forty eight thousand for a

project assistant sixty one thousand for

project Associates hundred and seventeen

thousand for a scrum Master a hundred

thousand for a program manager and a

hundred thousand for an operations

manager so these are all very healthy

salaries and of course you would

probably start off with one of the lower

level positions like project manager and

then you can move into something like

operations manager later on but these

are extremely good salaries especially

considering this is one of those

positions that you can get into with a

ton of different degrees or in many

cases no degree at all so overall I'm

gonna give it a salary score of nine out

of ten next one on the list is going to

be the production value and engagement

now this is extremely subjective it has

a lot to do with the personalities of

the people who actually present in the

course but if you look at the reviews

they do tend to be pretty good so for

instance this person says excellent

series overall and the Capstone finale

was very challenging the teacher was

very organized and professional and I

would recommend these courses to anyone

looking to get their PMP this person

says it's a very good introductory

course in project management mind you by

itself it's not enough to pass the PMB

exam but it does give you a basic

understanding of project management and

how you can apply project management to

your job the instructor is friendly and

the course material is of good quality

for me the highlights of the

specialization were the interviews with

pmps and the Capstone project I strongly

recommend everyone to take the Capstone

project because it's a very good

learning experience this person says I

enjoy the lectures the professor has a

good speaking and teaching style which

keeps me interested lots of concrete

math examples which make it easier to

understand very good slides which are

well formulated and easy to understand

now I will say that this is not one of

the certificates that when you look at

Reddit or YouTube comments have a ton of

positive comments like you look at with

the it Google professional certificate

that one you can just find a insane

amount of positive comments but that

doesn't mean I wasn't able to find some

there were definitely some on there and

overall all the different six courses

were either ranked 4.8 or 4.9 Stars so

for that reason for the production value

slash engagement I'm going to give this

one an 8 out of 10. next we're going to

talk about its chances of Landing you a

job now this will provide job

opportunities at over 300 different

companies it will open up doors for you

that were not available before and it

will make it easier for recruiters and

hiring managers to find you and on top

of that it does look good to have this

on your resume and a significant amount

of the course is dedicated to getting

you prepared for interviews and helping

you pass them and more and more people

are starting to see the value of these

Google certificates and they're starting

to become more and more respected in the

industry and on top of that there are a

ton of reviews of people who have gotten

jobs using this certificate so for

instance this person says yes you are

right it's a very good certification my

husband has done this in May to June of

2021. he got this certificate and got a

job as a deputy general manager he was a

principal civil engineer and got a job

as a deputy general manager in India I

don't know if he is also eligible to

apply to jobs in the UK without much

experience as a manager he started in

July that's an example of somebody

getting a job in India which is really

awesome because some of the products I

review are only available in First World

English-speaking countries so it's great

to see that there are options for other

people as well so this person said I did

it and as soon as I posted the badge to

my LinkedIn profile a bunch of

recruiters started calling me and I got

a new job through one granted the job

was actually as a product owner not a

project manager but that's mostly

because of the work experience on my

resume either way the completion of the

course really triggered alarm bells for

Recruiters on LinkedIn so in my opinion

it was super worth it here's another

person who says from my experience

several months ago the Coursera course

was very informative but definitely

heavily skewed towards Google's methods

and process it also was very very basic

like there was a whole segment on basic

resume writing so depending on where you

are on your career Journey it may have

portions that you fast track through

that being said it helped me land a

career switch from nursing to project

management here's a review from a

website called

reliablesoft.net which kind of reviews

all these sorts of things so the Google

project management professional

certificate is a good certificate for

those who want to work as a project

manager in just four months and for less

than 200 you can build the skills needed

to start a career in project management

the course material is easy to follow

and the quality of the instructors is

very good making this one of the best

entry-level project management

certifications and here is somebody who

got a job at Dell this was posted on the

Coursera page so as I work through my

Google certificate the possibilities of

my future began unfolding in my mind I

began to dream bigger which put me on a

journey that led me to Dell so yeah all

across the internet you are seeing

positive reviews for people who took

this certificate but with that being

said it's still a certificate that costs

39 a month right it's not a boot camp

that's going to get you like really well

prepared for project management so you

may have have to supplement this with

other things like creating a really good

portfolio for instance but overall it

might get you like 80 of the way there

and you even have a pretty decent chance

of getting a job and so I'm going to go

ahead and give this one an 8 out of 10

when it comes to the chances of Landing

you a job alright so now we're going to

talk about what value it offers overall

now when it comes to Value the way I

like to think about this is how much

time effort and money are you risking

and what is the possible reward that you

could get so the time you're risking is

a few months that's a heck of a lot less

than college or a boot camp the effort

that you're risking it's not going to be

super difficult you can do it at your

own pace and the money you're risking is

going to be 39 a month so you're not

risking much money either and the

potential reward is that you could get

yourself a completely new career right

you could start in a completely new

career without having to go to college

so from a risk reward perspective this

is excellent and what Giga brains are

doing is they're actually using these

Coursera certifications to look look

into different careers right so they'll

look into the you know project

management certificate they'll look into

the data analytics certificate they'll

look into the IT cert the ux design cert

Etc and they'll see which one seems to

fit their personality the best so this

is a quick and easy way to figure out

what careers are best for you and you

don't have to risk much time effort or

money whereas this happens all the time

where someone will go to college they're

two to three years into their degree and

they realize they don't want to do that

career so they just wasted two to three

years of their time a ton of effort and

a ton of money they're probably like

sixty thousand dollars in debt at that

point so that is the true value that

these Google certifications offer in my

opinion now with that being said 75 of

Google career certificate graduates in

the United States report an improvement

in their career trajectory so that's

pretty good considering a lot of people

are probably just taking it just to dip

their toe in they're taking it to

refresh on things and they're not

actually planning on changing careers

now certificates are becoming a viable

alternative to traditional education I

consider these to be a part of

alternative education we've already seen

how certificates have completely changed

the game and careers like it and that

same thing is going to happen in many

other related careers and the reason for

this is because colleges simply cannot

keep up with the demands of the

workforce and so that's why you see

these certificates popping up to fill in

the cracks now another thing that's

really great is they are going to have

you do applied learning projects which

not only is great because you learn the

most by doing but on top of that it's

going to build your portfolio and

portfolio is so important I cannot

describe how incredibly important a

portfolio is especially if you're trying

to get a job without a college degree so

not only are you going to learn the

theoretical knowledge but you're going

to learn practical skills that companies

actually want you to know and of course

you're going to earn the career

credential that you can put on your

resume as well as on your LinkedIn

you're going to learn a bunch of

valuable skills that are probably going

to be helpful to you regardless of

whether you go into project management

or not such as organizational culture

your career development strategic

thinking change management project

management stakeholder management

business writing project Charter project

planning risk management task estimation

and procurement and considering you're

barely risking any time effort or money

from a value perspective I have to give

this one a 10 out of 10. is it going to

get you a job guaranteed absolutely not

is it going to get you probably 80

percent of the way there very good

chance does it have a chance of getting

you a job with just the certificate

alone yes it does there's tons of

reviews on the internet that show that

that's true so overall the score is

going to be a 9.07 out of 10 this is a

great score for a certificate and I

think that if you understand the value

proposition of these certificates you're

not going to be disappointed by it the

only people who are disappointed are the

ones who think that the certificate is

like a golden ticket to a free job and

realistically speaking at 39 a month did

you really expect the certificate to

just automatically get you a job without

you having to do any other extra work

outside of it like do you really think

this certificate is going to be better

than a boot camp or a degree because a

boot camp and a degree still don't

guarantee you a job so overall a lot to

love here this is going to get a massive

Thumbs Up From Me definitely check it

out I'll put it down in the description

as well as the pin comment below and

there's a seven day free trial also if

favorite Google certificates are check
